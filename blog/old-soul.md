# Old Soul

>“There is a beautiful thing inside you that is thousands of years old.
>Too old to be captured in poems.
>Too old to be loved by everyone, but loved so very deeply by a chosen few.”

I am an old soul.

I've never really been able to explain why I love the antique things of life, I just know that I do and that I love the things that I love.

I know that I love the sensational music of [Nat King Cole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_King_Cole) and that my favourite song by him is [L-O-V-E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_HmF84G7ZY).

That I find the writings of [Khalil Gribran](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/kahlil-gibran) alluring and that my favourite piece by him [On Love](https://poets.org/poem/love-8) still moves me so long after I first read it.

And how one of my all-time favourite shows [How I Met Your Mother](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80010337?source=35) hasn't been on the air in 6 years yet I still watch it at least 3 times a year just so I can complain about an ending I've seen so many times before.

And although these examples might not suffice to some, I hope they get my point across. That I love the old things, the aged like wine old things, the things not many remember or consider.

I love the old things, even though the old life is not one I would want to live.

>“He had never been particularly young, or to put it another way, he had been young for a long time and now was at his true age, old enough for civilized comforts and not too old for the primal ones.”

I love how their truth is set in stone and with each passing year, they simply get better.

How [Kenny G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_G)'s [Forever In Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOO4ROO_sPM) is still as beautiful as it was in 1992 and how listening to it now, fills me with nostalgia and reminds of the days spent sitting in front of the TV as it played in interludes on [ZNBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia_National_Broadcasting_Corporation).

How anytime I hear someone say "[do you remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs069dndIYk)," my mind races to complete the lyrics "the 21st night of September?"

And however odd it is, I find myself missing the simplicity of a life I never lived, desiring an era when we weren't slaves to very things we made and built to set us free.

A time before likes, hearts, retweets and karma was not a measure of our worth.

I crave a simpler time, one filled with early morning walks just before dew disappeared, of clearer nights so I can gaze at the stars as I search for Orion's Belt.

>“And I learned what is obvious to a child. That life is simply a collection of little lives, each lived one day at a time. That each day should be spent finding beauty in flowers and poetry and talking to animals. That a day spent with dreaming and sunsets and refreshing breezes cannot be bettered. But most of all, I learned that life is about sitting on benches next to ancient creeks with my hand on her knee and sometimes, on good days, for falling in love.”
