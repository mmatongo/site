For as long as I can remember, I have always loved taking
walks. I'm not sure if it's the calmness of natures silence
or my desperate need to wholly embrace the company of self,
whatever the case, I have always loved taking walks.

On my many walks, I would always see trees and flowers of
various kinds in varying conditions. I always appreciated
their subtle beauty and marvelled at some of the trees and
their monolithic and sometimes humble sizes.

A few days ago I was reading on the practice of observing
without judgment and the more I read, the more I began to
see the disparity of human observance, how we look upon
nature so differently to the way we look upon ourselves.

In its imperfection, all nature is imperfectly perfect. How
easy it is to look at the crooked tree and see only the
artistic beauty behind how it twists and turns, how it
curves as it stretches out to follow the sunlight in a dance
that can only be attributed to nature’s artistry.

So much like trees, not everyone got the same measure of
sunlight, or to sprout in-kind soils, or to grow where the
waters are bountiful, or to know the kindness of a gaze
filled with awe at their beauty.

So when you look at all men as you do tree's, you won't say
"Why are you like this?" or "You’re too this," you will
merely accept them for who they are and in doing so, will
embrace the true beauty of humanity, that in our vast
diversity, we are  **_imperfectly perfect_**.

That our beauty is expressed by our diversity, that with
each distinct difference we are set apart from the next and
defined as  **_beautiful_**, as  **_perfect_**  and not
merely a semblance of perfection.
