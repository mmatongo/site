The question, "What year do you look back to with fondness?"
often causes my mind to race back to the year 2014, not that
anything special happened in 2014. I like to think that the
reason I always look to it with much fondness is that it was
my last year in high school and looking back now, I never
thought a detail I often considered insignificant would have
such great impact on how I look back to that year.

Over the years, I've made it a habit to ask friends and
close acquaintances the seemingly arbitrary question, "What
year do you often look back to with fondness?" the question
itself lacking no real specificity asks the seemingly
impossible.
I mean how do you respond to a question that doesn't ask for
an exact moment in time but rather asks you to sieve out the
good from the bad, measuring out each year to see it's worth
in either the joy it gave or the joy it took.

The more you look at this seemingly pointless question the
more you begin to sieve out the good from the bad and with
confidence, you can easily blurt out a year that by your own
standards was good, that had in it joy and sadness and how
even the sadness within it you look back at it with
fondness, with spirited comfort knowing deep down that
despite all the hurdles that life presented you during that
sliver of eternity, you came out strong.  **You came out on
top.**

So you look back to it and see the joy, pain, sadness and
tears cried in laughter and you remember only those moments,
the simple yet beautiful moments  _etched in memory,_  like
the inscriptions of a vandal on the walls of your mind
announcing, "We have known joy, we have known sadness, we
have seen the bitterness of life and we have embraced its
kindness and through it all, we have lived." And with each
breath since, we have lived  **more**.
